Hi, this is Dharma Naidu and Vikash Singh's code for our CS188 project.
The project is a comparison of machine learning methods for prediction of whether pixels in a patient's brain hemorrhage using data from MRI scans.

The input data is the file "cs188TD.csv", obtained from UCLA.

Make sure before you run, appropriate python modules are installed.

We would like to be considered for the best project award.
